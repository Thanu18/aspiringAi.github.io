                Hello there!  My journey has taken me through roles like Research Assistant, Research Engineer, Application Engineer, System Analyst, and Data Scientist, each adding a new thread to my rich tapestry of skills.
                I’m on an exciting new path as I transition into an AI Engineer role, driven by a passion to spark technological breakthroughs. 
                
                When I’m not immersed in tech, you’ll find me hiking through nature or lost in the pages of a great book—activities that inspire my creativity and problem-solving prowess.

                                Credit card fraud detection project is designed to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent using machine learning techniques. 
                                The project leverages Python, Docker, Streamlit, and MLFlow to build and deploy the model. It uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle, 
                                which involves feature transformation through principal component analysis and handling data imbalance with SMOTE. Categorical features are encoded for model training.
                                Three predictive models are compared: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The Gradient Boosting Algorithm achieves the highest accuracy at 95%, 
                                demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. The project includes interactive visualizations using Streamlit to display model performance and other insights.

                                Find the Answers is a Streamlit application that leverages Google’s Generative AI to analyze uploaded images and generate responses based on user prompts. 
                                This app utilizes the Gemini Pro Vision model from Google’s API to provide insights and answers related to the content of the uploaded image.

                                The dataset features transactions from 1000 customers and 800 merchants, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
                                Key steps include balancing the data through oversampling, engineering features, and scaling. Logistic Regression and XGBoost models were trained and evaluated, 
                                with XGBoost showing better performance after hyperparameter tuning. Models and preprocessing pipelines were saved and deployed via a Flask application on Azure, enabling real-time fraud detection.

                                This project is a Flask web application for classifying medical images into HP and SSA categories using pre-trained DenseNet, ResNet50, and Fully Connected Convolutional Network (FNN) models.
                                It is deployed on AWS. Installation involves setting up Python 3.8+, Docker, and AWS tools. The application can be run locally with Docker by building the image and accessing it via http://localhost:5000. 
                                The project includes data preprocessing with SMOTE to address class imbalance and uses various models for classification.
                                For troubleshooting, ensure Pillow is installed and verify Dockerfile and AWS configurations. The project saves and reloads models for predictions using standard methods.
